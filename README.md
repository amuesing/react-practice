The DogBook

This challenge will ask you to create a page full of dogs known as "The DogBook". It is legally not similar to any other page.

Step 1:
Open a new React app page by going to "react.new" in your browser

Step 2:
Make an api call to the following API to get dog images
https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random/15

Step 3:
Render a centered header with the title "Welcome to the DogBook" with a padding bottom of 15

Step 4:
Render a grid of dogs with their image, a fake name and a checkbox with the label "good boy?"
*** for the fake name feel free to add the faker gem and use faker.name.firstName()

Step 5:
Make sure each dog card has a thin border, around 10 pixels of padding around it and that their name is in a small header.

Step 6:
Hard code some dogs to be good boys, then implement a filter toggle button that only shows good boys, bad boys or all dogs.

Step 7:
Wire up the checkbox on each dog card so it is functional to toggle on and off whether a dog is a good boy 
in a way that persists throughout one visit to the site
